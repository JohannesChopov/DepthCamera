# DepthCamera
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to utilize an Intel Realsense D435 camera for volume or mass estimations of objects. This is a stereoscopic camera with an IR-dot pattern meant for distance measurements. The camera will point vertically to the ground and make real-time estimations of the volume of the objects that pass through its view.
